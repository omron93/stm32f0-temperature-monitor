stm32f0-temperature-monitor
===========================

My graduation project at grammar school.

This project uses STM32F0 board to measure the temperature with DS18B20 digital thermometer.

There is also gui program where you can set two values - range of valid temperatures.
-> Actual value is displayed on LEDs and if the temperature is out of that range program 
will turn on high power elements (for example: fan to cool and resistor to heat)
